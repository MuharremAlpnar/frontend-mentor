## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- scss for styles


### What I learned

I tried to write SCSS because I had difficulty writing CSS. And I learned how to use media queries for responsive design.


### Continued development

I want to learn JavaScript, but my priority is to thoroughly learn CSS and create responsive designs that are more responsive to screen sizes without relying on Bootstrap.
